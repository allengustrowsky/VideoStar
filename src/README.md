# Site Description and General Information
This site mimmicks a movie platform that serves both free and paid videos to users.  Adding paid videos to the cart will "purchase" them, at which point they will act mostly like a free video (e.g., they can be favorited, viewed in theater mode, etc.).  However, they will still appear in the "paid" filter.  In addition to their default view, videos can also be viewed in theater and full-screen mode.
